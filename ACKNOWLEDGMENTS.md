## Expert Review & Validation

The Morrison Invariant framework has been reviewed and validated by:

**Dr. Edinei Santin**
- Former Postdoctoral Fellow, CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research)
- Senior IC Designer, AlpsenTek GmbH
- PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering, NOVA University of Lisbon
- Specializations: Neuromorphic computing, fundamental physics, machine intelligence
- LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/edineisantin?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app]

Dr. Santin provided critical technical review of the geometric formalism 
and its applicability across digital, analog, and neuromorphic substrates.

## Additional Validation

This framework has been independently validated through detailed technical 
analysis by multiple frontier AI systems:
- OpenAI GPT-4
- Anthropic Claude
- Microsoft Copilot
- xAI Grok
- Mistral Le Chat
